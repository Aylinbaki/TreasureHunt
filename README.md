🗺️ Treasure Hunt

📌 About the Project

TreasureHunt is a Java-based project developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.  
The aim is to implement a single-player treasure hunt game using linked lists and stacks.  
The player explores rooms, collects treasures, and faces traps, while movements are recorded in stacks.  

🎮 Features

Map Representation: Rooms are represented as nodes in a linked list.  
Player Exploration: All moves are recorded in a custom stack.  
Treasure Collection: Treasures found in rooms are pushed onto a treasure stack.  
Trap Mechanism: Dice roll decides success (even) or failure (odd → return to previous room).  
Game End Conditions:  
Player collects all treasures, or  
Player visits all rooms.  

📂 Project Structure

Room.java → Defines the room structure (linked list node).  
Stack.java → Custom stack implementation for moves and treasures.  
Game.java → Controls the game flow and rules.  
gamemap.txt → Defines the map and room connections.  

📚 Notes

This project was created as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course.  
It focuses on practicing linked lists, stacks, and algorithmic problem-solving in a game environment.
